            <p>Brief</p>

            <p>Create a portfolio website which presents you as a dev and IT professional. The purpose is to provide an online portfolio that provides information about you, your skills, interests, professional knowledge and a showcase of your work.</p>

            <p>This was pretty much my first ever website</p>
            <p>First ever using HTML CSS and a bit of JavaScript on the into page</p>
            <p>This was a showcase of my creative side more then anything else. I just really didn't want to have a site that looked like all the others</p>
