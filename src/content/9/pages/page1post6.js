            <p>I finished the Minesweeper app with loads of time to spare so I decided to test take things up a notch with some AI</p>

            <p>Overall it works but can only go 4 levels into the minimax algorithm and it is not super smart. Going 5 levels down takes a long time to make a move.</p>
