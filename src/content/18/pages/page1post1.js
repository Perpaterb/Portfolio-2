            <p>In a nutshell the concept was a springy gallery.</p>
            <p>Click on a bubble and explore the gallery inside</p> <br/>
            <p>Things that still need work:</p>
            <p>1. Mobile vew.</p>
            <p>2. Gallery can't have images or pages with different aspects ratios.</p>
            <p>3. As an individual part the smaller pages in the gallery move much more freely.</p>
