            <p>I have completely changed the way the mounting plate works. Now itâ€™s glued onto the inner case and the outer case is screwed on last.</p>
            
            <p>It's hard to explain. I hope the pictures help.</p>
            
            <p>Basically now I can see the cables on the back of the mounting plate and there are no visible screws holding it in place.</p>
            
            <p>I am however losing a little rigidity over all as the inner case can only be screwed onto the outer case on one side</p>
